        <p>Hopper is the codename for Nvidia's GPU Datacenter
             microarchitecture that will be parallel release of 
             Lovelace (for Consumer). It is named after the American 
             computer scientist and United States Navy Rear Admiral 
             Grace Hopper. Hopper was once rumored to be Nvidia's 
             first generation of GPUs that will use multi-chip modules
            (MCMs), although the H100 announcement showed a massive
            monolithic die.[1][2][3][4][5][6] Nvidia officially announced
             the Hopper GPU microarchitecture and H100 GPU at GTC 2022 on
              March 22, 2022.</p><hr>
